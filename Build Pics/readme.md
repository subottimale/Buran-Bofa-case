Whether you're using the custom top-mount plate provided in this repository or the gasket-mount plate from the original Buran design, you'll need a handful of M2 heatset inserts (4mm length recommended).

If using the top-mount plate, just 4 points are recommended, all 6 is optional. I use the 4 corners and leave the bottom unsecured, as below:
